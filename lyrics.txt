The old persists alongside and despite the new. appoach paths as not only solitary places but also sociable ones where once silenced voices might be heard. I feel the wind-stirred trees at an old crossroads give whispered voice to a now vanished village; they eavesdrop on the clink, the roar, the hum of old smithies and inns.
